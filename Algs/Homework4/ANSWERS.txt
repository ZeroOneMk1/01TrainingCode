Question 1:
The problem is that this version of the algorithm chooses pivots based on location annd not sizxe, and so the pivot can someties be 0, eading to division by 0 errors.


Question 2:
This is a Redundant matrix because row1 + row2 = row3

To remedy this, we can check during selection of every pivot if every number in a column is 0. If it is, the system is Redundant and has multiple solutions.
