Lucas number at position 39 is 141422324, time taken: 0.412025 seconds
Lucas number at position 40 is 228826127, time taken: 0.666511 seconds
Lucas number at position 41 is 370248451, time taken: 1.066291 seconds
Lucas number at position 42 is 599074578, time taken: 1.735587 seconds
Lucas number at position 43 is 969323029, time taken: 2.909913 seconds
Lucas number at position 44 is 1568397607, time taken: 4.718994 seconds

The time taken to do each lucas number doubles for each added depth, as expected by a recursive function that calls itself twice.

Therefore, the order of growth of this Lucas Number algorithm is exponential O(2^n)

The ratio these numbers approach is 1.618033988749895, which is the golden ratio.

even when starting with the immature and completely unrelated numbers 69 and 420, the ratio still approaches 1.6180339887498951, which is neat.
The order of growth also stays the same.

SUBIRACH

There are 88 subsets of 4 numbers that add up to 33

The most common sum is 66 with 1364 possible combinations.

This sum is exactly half of the maximum sum of 132, and double the sum of any diagonal, horizontal, or vertical, or square of 4 (etc)

with 65536 total subsets of the square, I don't quite understand the relevance of 1364. It's about a 48th
